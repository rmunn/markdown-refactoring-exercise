## First impressions

That's even uglier than the Ledger.fs code was! I'm glad there are unit tests,
because if I had to follow the logic of the code without unit tests to tell me
what it's supposed to do, it would take me a couple of hours to work it out.

My plan is to create an AST to represent a Markdown file, then write a separate
function to format that AST as HTML. We'll see what the best way of parsing the
original Markdown file is: either predicate functions or active patterns might
work well. I'm going to try active patterns, though, because they usually end
up looking cleaner than an `if pred1 then ... elif pred2 then ... else` block.

## Step 0

Before we do ANYTHING else to this file, let's fix its indentation. The entire
`parse` function is indented by 3 spaces rather than 4, although internally it's
indented by 4 spaces. This means that when I hit Tab in VS Code, I get just one
space of indentation from the previous line. But if I hit Tab again, I'm going
to get *five* spaces. We'll fix this by simply adding a space to every line. In
order to make the Git diffs of my next steps readable, I'm going to make this
whitespace change as a separate commit.
